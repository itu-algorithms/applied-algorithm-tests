  ## Goal

  The purpose of this exercise is to enable you to help verify the correctness of your HyperLogLog implementation, as described in the instructions of Mandatory Assignment 3.

  ## Mathematical description

  Let $m=1024$ be the number of registers, and let $M[0],M[1],\ldots,M[m-1]$ be the said registers, initially initialized to zero. Given a sequence of 32-bit integers, compute two hash values for each such integer $y$: $j=f(y)$ and $x=h(x)$ where the function $f(x)$ is `f(x) = ((x*0xbc164501) & 0x7fffffff) >> 21`, and the function $h(x)$ is as in Exercise 1. Use the hash $j\in\{0,1,\ldots,1023\}$ as a register index to select a register, and use the hash value $x$ to update the register value using the $\rho$ function from Exercise 2, and set $M[j] \gets \max \{ M[j], \rho(x) \}$.

  ## Specification of your program

  Your program should read from standard input an arbitrary number of unsigned 32-bit integers, supplied as 8-byte hex strings. Each line contains exactly one value.

  Once your program reaches the end of input, it should print out $m$ lines, the values of the registers, as ordinary decimal numbers, one value per line.
