  ## Goal

  The purpose of this exercise is to continue practising simple tasks that require bit operations. In this case, we compute the population count (popcount) of a bit vector, that is, the number of one bits (bit positions that are "populated"). This is also known as the Hamming weight or bit sum.

  You should use bitwise operators available in your language that operate on words. Do not convert the integer values into strings; this is very inefficient.

  ## Mathematical description

  Given an unsigned 64-bit integer $x$, the population count is simply the number of bits that are one, or equivalently the sum of all bits in the integer. If we denote the $i$th bit by $x_i$, then the population count would be equal to $\sum_{i=0}^{63} x_i$. For the purposes of this assignment, a simple summation will do. There are ways to make this computation more efficient, but they are beyond the scope of this assignment.

  ## Specification of your program

  Your program should read a number of unsigned integers from standard input, compute the population count of each integer, and output the population counts into standard output on separate lines.

  The first line of the input contains one integers $n$ that is equal to the number of integers that follow.

  The remaining $n$ lines each contain an unsigned 64-bit integer as a 16-byte hex string.

  Your program should output $n$ lines each containing the population count as a decimal number (between 0 and 64, inclusive).
